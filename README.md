## Model Providers

This template uses the [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) to access multiple AI models through a unified interface. The default configuration includes [xAI](https://x.ai) models (`grok-2-vision-1212`, `grok-3-mini`) routed through the gateway.

### AI Provider

This template is configured to use [OpenAI](https://openai.com) directly. With the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction), you can also switch to other LLM providers like [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Running locally

This application is configured for local development and doesn't require cloud services.

### Required Environment Variables

You only need two environment variables to get started:

1. `BEEPER_MCP_TOKEN` - Your Beeper MCP token for tool integration
2. `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key

### Quick Start

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

2. Edit `.env.local` and add your tokens:
```
BEEPER_MCP_TOKEN=your_beeper_mcp_token_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

3. Install dependencies and run:
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Local Storage

The application uses:
- **SQLite** for the database (stored in `./data/sqlite.db`)
- **Local filesystem** for uploaded files (stored in `./public/uploads/`)

Both directories are automatically created on first run and are gitignored.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env.local` file as it contains sensitive API keys.
